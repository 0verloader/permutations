#PERMUTATIONS
"""
Permutations are the different ways that you can arrange N objects. Given N objects, there are N! permutations. This algorithm returns all the sets for numbers 0 to N-1. For example given as input 5 it outputs permutations such as 0,1,2,3,4  ,  1,0,2,3,4  , 1,3,2,4,0 etc.
This algorithm is very usefull for anadroms, keys creating and generally when you want to get the permutation of a set of objects in an array. So you just have to get the permutation of indexes and reconstruct the permutation/
